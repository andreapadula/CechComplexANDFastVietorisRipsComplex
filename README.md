# CechComplexANDFastVietorisRipsComplex

In   my   final   project   I   decided   to   implement   a   faster   way   to   computer   Vietoris-Rips Complex.   I   will   use   the   paper   that   I   will   propose   next   week   (“Fast   Construction   of   the Vietoris-Rips   Complex”)   to   implement   my   final   project.   My   goal   for   this   project   is   to create   a   filter   in   TTK,   that   is   faster   than   the   one   that   we   created   in   Assignment   2.
In   paper   that   I   chose,   as   the   title   suggested   the   author   presents   a   fast   algorithms   for constructing   the   Vietoris-Rips   complex   of   a   point   set.   This   complex   is   fairly   used   in topological   data   analysis,   and   its   construction   can   be   hard   to   implement   efficiently.   The paper   formulate   a   two-phase   approach   so   my   filter   will   composed   by   two   phases:      one geometric   and   one   topological.   In   fact,   the   first   part,   I   will   be   building   my   neighborhood graph   and   the   second   part,   I   will   be   building   Vietoris-Rips   complex   from   the neighborhood   graph   previously   built.
